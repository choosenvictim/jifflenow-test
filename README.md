# jifflenow-test

I forked this project using my own React Webpack setup repo and then cut it down to minimalistic dependencies. 
Things I have used here:-
```
1. React
2. Redux
3. Webpack
```

To run this project, follow these steps:-
```
1. npm install 
2. npm start
```

This will run a local webpack dev server on port 8080. Hit ```http://localhost:8080``` to see the code in action
